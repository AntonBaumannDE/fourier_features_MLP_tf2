# gaussian_fourier_MLP_tf2

Replicated some JAX snippets in TF2 to see how passing the input through Fourier feature mappings performs on different images and parameters. 
This method enabled the NERF implementation by Mildenhall et al. to render photorealistic scenes. 
However, it can also be applied to other problems such as 2D-image regression.
